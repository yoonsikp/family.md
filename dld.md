# Dyslipidemia
Routine screening can start between 30-40 years of age (younger for males). A normal lipid screen in otherwise healthy individuals can be repeated in 5 years. Fasting tends to cause a decrease in triglyceride levels. Non-fasting levels are recommended for risk stratification. Signs of marked dyslipidemia on exam include palmar/skin xanthoma, yellowish bumps near the eyelid, or hepatosplenomegaly.

## Types of lipids
- Triglycerides
- Cholesterol
- Lipoprotein
  - incl. HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL, Chylomicrons (ULDL)
  - Apo B, Lipoprotein (a)/Apo (a) --> associated with LDL
  - Apo A-I --> associated with HDL

## Management
Dyslipidemia carries the risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease including stroke, MI, etc, as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Very high triglycerides also carries risk of pancreatitis. As a general rule, the lower the lipoprotein density, the more atherogenic the effcts, therefore, LDL cholesterol is an important target in elevated cholesterol. Uncontrolled LDL cholesterol can result in fatty deposits and atherosclerosis, resulting in oxidative stress, decrease in vessel diameter, and possible thrombogenesis.

With an isolated increase in triglycerides, consider causes such as: obesity, hypothyroidism, EtOH intake, DM2, and familial hypertriglyceridemia. Fibrates can treat high triglycerides, but cannot be used together with statins.

Statins should always be started in those with atherosclerotic changes, stroke, TIA, PAD, CVD, AAA, chronic kidney disease, DM2 or longstanding DM1. The Framingham score can be used to stratify risks of dyslipidemia and help with management. If >10% consider moderate-intensity statins. If >20% consider high-intensity statins. If <10% statins are generally not indicated. ASA can be considered in primary prevention if the 10-y CVD risk is >= 20% and bleeding risk is low. Do not start statins if age >75, unless patient can tolerate well.

- Exercise as prescription, 5 to 7 days of the week, Moderate Intensity, Aerobic or cardiorespiratory, 30-60 min/session
- diet and exercise
- fish oil
- smoking cessation
- intermittent fasting can help with triglyceride levels.
- liver enzymes, HSM r/o, u/s? if necessary
- Niacin can be used to treat high triglycerides and sometimes high LDL/low HDL. (s/e includes Hyperuricemia)
- Target > 50% reduction of LDL-C or <=2 mmol/L LDL-C. LDL-C should even be lower in those with cardiac risks.
