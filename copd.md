# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Subsets of COPD include emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is destruction of the air sacs, while chronic bronchitis is the inflammation of the airways to your lungs.

## Background
Symptoms include shortness of breath that worsens on exertion, and cough with or without sputum. Most commonly associated with smoking, or occupational environmental exposures. Rarely caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Only severe cases have associated CXR findings.

## Diagnosis
COPD patients will have an FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7, with minimal signs of reversibility with bronchodilator compared to asthma. Low FEV1 is pathognomonic for obstruction.

## Exacerbation Ex.
Sputum and cough

## Initial Treatment
Low Ex. + Low Sx. = Any bronchodilator
Low Ex. + High Sx. = LABA or LAMA
High Ex. + Low Sx. = LAMA
High Ex. + High Sx. = LABA + LAMA, (ICS + LABA if eosinophilic)

## Long Term
Reduce smoke exposure, continue exercise.
