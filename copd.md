# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Subsets of COPD include emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is destruction of the air sacs, while chronic bronchitis is the inflammation of the airways to your lungs.

## Background
Symptoms include shortness of breath that worsens on exertion, and cough with or without sputum. Most commonly associated with smoking, or occupational environmental exposures. Rarely caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Only severe cases have associated CXR findings.

## Diagnosis
COPD patients will have an FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7, with minimal signs of reversibility with bronchodilator compared to asthma. Low FEV1 is pathognomonic for obstruction.

## Acute Exacerbation
Symptoms include dyspnea, purulent or increased sputum, cough. Start oxygen therapy, target is ~90-92%. Obtain VBG and consider nebulizer if indicated.

- Mild: SABA (e.g. Salbutamol q1-2h)
- Moderate: SABA + SAMA (e.g. Ipratropium q1-2h)
- Severe: SABA + SAMA + systemic corticosteroids (e.g. Prednisone 30-60 mg OD)

Antibiotics (e.g. Azithromycin 500 mg PO OD) +/- sputum culture if concern for infection

- RSI: Use ketamine for induction and succinylcholine for paralysis

## Outpatient Treatment (GOLD 2020)
Try to divide patients into: High Risk for Exacerbation vs High Symptoms using COPD Assessment Test. High risk for exacerbation: >= 1 severe exacerbation per year. Start with a rescue puffer: short-acting bronchodilator.

- Low Ex. + Low Sx. = Any bronchodilator
- Low Ex. + High Sx. = LABA (e.g. Salmeterol BID) or LAMA
- High Ex. + Low Sx. = LAMA (e.g. Tiotropium OD)
- High Ex. + High Sx. = LABA (e.g. Formoterol BID) + LAMA, (ICS + LABA if eosinophilic)

Start triple therapy for those who have severe COPD symptoms.

## Long Term Treatment (improves mortality)
- Supplement oxygen if resting O2 <= 88%. Wear for 15hr/day.
- Provide Tdap + PPSV23/PCV20 + flu vaccine.
- Reduce smoke exposure
- Continue exercise.

## Differential Diagnosis
- Asthma (reversible)
- Bronchiectasis (purulent sputum, bacterial)
- Heart failure
- Tuberculosis
- Obliterative bronchiolitis, i.e. popcorn lung (obtain HRCT)
