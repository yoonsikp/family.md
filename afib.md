# Atrial Fibrillation

## Types of Atrial Fibrillation
- Paroxysmal: terminates spontaneously within 7 days
- Persistent AF: episodes last longer than 7 days
- Long-standing persistent AF: lasting for more than 12 months

## Symptoms
- Palpitations
- Tachycardia
- Dizziness
- Dyspnea
- Embolic event

## Risk Factors
- Alcohol
- Hyperthyroidism
- Advanced age
- Obesity
- Obstructive sleep apnea

## Management
If hemodynamically unstable, urgent rhythm control (cardioversion). For younger patients (<80 yrs) or those who are at high cardiovascular risk, first-line therapy is rhythm control. If <48 hrs of AF, cardioversion can be attempted immediately (some guidelines also suggest if <12 hours of clear onset AF symptoms and otherwise healthy), this requires 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion. If >48 hrs of AF or unsure, three weeks of anticoagulation is needed before and four weeks of anticoagulation is needed after cardioversion. Refer to cardiology for ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs.

- Assess for stability and thromboembolic symptoms
- 12-lead EKG +/- echocardiogram
- Rhythm control: electrical or pharmacological cardioversion, ablation, etc.
  - Pharmacological: procainamide infusion 1g over 60 min IV
  - If pharmacological failed, electrical cardioversion
- Rate control: used for symptom management and/or not being cardioverted
  - Cardioselective beta blocker (may worsen pulmonary edema)
    - metoprolol tartrate (short-acting) 25 mg PO BID
    - atenolol 25 mg PO OD
    - bisoprolol 2.5mg PO OD
  - Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (may cause hypotension)
    - verapamil 40mg PO TID, extended release 120mg OD
    - diltiazem 30mg PO QID, extended release 120mg OD


- Long term anticoagulation to prevent embolic risk
  - Must consider bleeding risk
  - CHADS score >= 1 would warrant anticoagulation
    - CHF, HTN, Age >= 75, DM, Stroke/TIA (+2)
  - DOAC
    - Apixaban 5mg PO BID (2.5mg BID for EGFR 15-50) - lower bleeding risk
    - Rivaroxaban 20mg PO OD (15mg OD for EGFR 15-50)
  - LMWH
