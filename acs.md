# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Types of ACS:
- ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), troponin rise
- Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), troponin rise, ?T wave changes
- Unstable Angina (UA), no troponin rise, but severe, sudden, or worsening angina > 20 minutes

If unclear do a repeat troponin in 3hrs. Low risk patients with negative troponin after 3 hrs of symptoms can rule-out MI. Don't use nitrates in those with Right-sided Heart Failure, HOCM, bradycardia, severe hypotension or PDE5 inihibitors.

## STEMI
- Acute management
    - Antiplatelet: aspirin (160mg loading, 81mg OD) + ticagrelor (180 mg loading, 90mg BID)
    - Nitrates: e.g. nitrate spray, max 3 sprays/15 min for angina
    - Anticoagulation: enoxaparin, fondaparinux, or Unfractionated Heparin (UFH).
        - Started before PCI then stopped after procedure. Started with Fibrinolysis or without reperfusion therapy, then stopped after 8 days or sooner.
        - Enoxaparin: IV bolus of 30 mg followed by 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (24 hrs if eGFR<30)
        - Fondaparinux: 2.5 mg SC OD
        - UFH for PCI: IV bolus of UFH of 70 to 100 units/kg up to a maximum of 10,000 units (with additional boluses if needed, ACT target > 250s)
        - UFH for Fibrinolysis: IV bolus of UFH of 60 units/kg up to a maximum of 4000 units, IV infusion of 12 units/kg/hour (maximum 1000 units/hour) aPTT target 50-75s
    - PCI or Fibrinolysis +/- PCI
        - PCI if can be done within 90 min of medical contact
            - ASAP, within 30 min of entering hospital
        - Fibrinolysis if PCI cannot be done within 120 min of medical contact
            - ASAP, within 10 min of decision being made
    - Beta Blocker within 24 hrs, defer if in heart failure
    - Statin within 24 hrs

- Non-acute management
    - Echocardiogram for LVEF
    - Stress test
    - ACEi
    - Spirinolactone
    - Beta blocker
    - Aspirin forever, additional antiplatelet for at least 1 year

## NSTEACS (NSTEMI or UA)
- Acute management
    - Antiplatelet: aspirin 
    - Nitrates: nitrate spray, max 3 sprays in 15 min for angina
    - Anticoagulation: enoxaparin or fondaparinux (conservative ~48 hrs) or UFH (Invasive +/- PCI) 
        - Enoxaparin â€“ 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (24 hrs if eGFR<30)
        - Fondaparinux: 2.5 mg SC OD
        - UFH for PCI: IV bolus of UFH of 70 to 100 units/kg up to a maximum of 10,000 units (with additional boluses if needed, ACT target > 250s)
        - UFH for Invasive: IV bolus of UFH of 60 units/kg up to a maximum of 4000 units, IV infusion of 12 units/kg/hour (maximum 1000 units/hour) aPTT target 50-75s
    - Immediate vs Invasive vs Conservative approach
    - Indications for Immediate Angiography and Revascularization:
        - Hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock
        - Severe left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure
        - Persistent rest angina despite intensive medical therapy
        - New or worsening mitral regurgitation or new ventricular septal defect
        - sustained ventricular arrhythmias
        - TIMI risk score of 3 or greater
    - Contraindicated Fibrinolysis
    - Beta Blocker within 24 hrs, defer if in heart failure
    - Statin within 24 hrs

- Non-acute management
    - Echocardiogram for LVEF
    - Stress test
    - ACEi
    - Spirinolactone
    - Aspirin forever, additional antiplatelet for max 1 year
    - Nitrates PRN
