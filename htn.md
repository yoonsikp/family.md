# Hypertension (HTN)

- Measure Blood Pressure in all patients annually

## Signs of end organ damage (EOD)
- Coronary Artery Disease
- Left Ventricular Hypertrophy
- Carotid Artery Disease
- Stroke or TIA
- Retinopathy
- Peripheral Artery Disease
- Kidney Disease

## Pressure Cutoff for Hypertension
- Using Automatic Office Blood Pressure >= (135/85)
- Classic Office Blood Pressure >= (140/90), more likely to have white-coat HTN
- Using Home Blood Pressure over 7 days, 2x at morning + 2x at night >= (135/85)
    - Omron brand preferred, more devices on https://hypertension.ca/bpdevices

## Non-pharmacologic Treatments
- Aerobic exercise, resistance training okay for mild-moderate HTN
- Weight loss, BMI <25
- Relaxation and Meditation
- Diet (Mediterranean, DASH, ?MIND)
    - whole grains, cereals
    - fresh fruit and vegetables
    - fish, chicken, legumes, nuts
    - olive oil
    - low-fat dairy
    - limit red meat, fried foods, and sugars
- Abstain from smoking and EtOH

## Pharmacologic Treatment Threshold and BP Targets
- If Higher risk (DM, CKD, CVD, Age >= 75) and BP >= (130/80)
    - Target (130/80)
- If Medium risk (EOD, CV risk factors) and BP >= (135/85)
    - Target (135/85)
- If Low risk (healthy) and BP >= (160/100)
    - Target (140/90)

## Pharmacotherapies
- Thiazide diuretics
  - Chlorthalidone
  - indapamide
  - HCTZ
- ACEi + ARBs (don't use if pregnant)
    - Irbesartan or Telmisartan has a long half-life
    - Candesartan can be used twice a day
- Long-acting Dihydropyridine CCBs (c.f. non-DHP CCBs affect only the heart)
    - amlodipine
- Nonselective Beta Blockers
  - Carvedilol (also used for MI, HFrEF, cirrhosis)
  - Lebatalol (in pregnancy or non-HF hypertensive emergency)

## Initial Screening
- Urinalysis and ACR
- Chem7 + Creatinine
- HbA1c or fasting glucose
- Lipids (TG + Cholesterol)
- ECG

## Follow-up
- For ACEi + ARB, check Creatinine and K+ in 2 weeks. If elevated, reduce dose by 50% and repeat bloodwork in 2 weeks
- Every month until BP reaches target
- Every 6 months for BP checkups once target reached
- Resistant hypertension if >= 3 medications have been tried without BP control, refer to specialist
- Repeat bloodwork as necessary (every 1-3 yrs)

## Hypertensive Emergencies
- Nicardipine
- Nitroglycerine (avoid in right-sided heart failure)
- Esmolol or Lebatalol (avoid in decompensated HF)
- Hydralazine (difficult to dose)
