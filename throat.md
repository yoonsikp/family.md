# Pharyngitis and Related Conditions

## Common Causes

### Infectious Mononucleosis (Mono)
90% of cases are caused by Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), 5% by Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Usually spread through saliva. Symptoms include fatigue, sore throat, swollen tonsils. Diagnosis can be done with Anti-VCA IgG (previous infection) and Anti-VCA IgM (acute phase) serology. Bloodwork may show elevated liver enzymes. Advise against contact sports for 1-2 months, and any hepatotoxic insults. 

### Streptococcal  Pharyngitis (Strep throat)
Caused by Group A Streptococcus. No antibiotic resistance seen in this group. Can be diagnosed with throat culture or rapid strep swab. CENTOR score is useful for risk stratificaction. Penicillin or amoxicillin are first-line treatments for strep throat. Do not give amoxicillin if Mono is also suspected, azithromycin can be used instead.

### Viral URTI
Another common cause of pharyngitis. Usually presents with low grade fever (as opposed to bacterial infection). Supportive care.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Throat pain associated with GERD, usually worse with supine positioning, smoking, EtOH etc. Treat with PPI and lifestyle changes.
