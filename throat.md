# Pharyngitis, Throat, and Related Conditions

## Common Causes

### Infectious Mononucleosis (Mono)
90% of cases are caused by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), 5% by Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Usually spread through saliva. Symptoms include fatigue, sore throat, swollen tonsils. Diagnosis can be done with Anti-VCA IgG (previous infection) and Anti-VCA IgM (acute phase) serology. Bloodwork may show elevated liver enzymes. Advise against contact sports for 1-2 months, and any hepatotoxic insults. 

### Streptococcal  Pharyngitis (Strep throat)
Caused by Group A Streptococcus. No antibiotic resistance seen in this group. Can be diagnosed with throat culture or rapid strep swab. CENTOR score is useful for risk stratificaction. Penicillin or amoxicillin are first-line treatments for strep throat. Do not give amoxicillin if Mono is also suspected, azithromycin can be used instead.

### Croup (Subglottis)
Viral infection of the subglottis affecting children <5 years of age. Symptoms incluide barky cough, inspiratory stridor, and increased work of breathing. Commonly caused by parainfluenza, and usually improves <7 days. Steeple sign may be seen on frontal chest X-ray, but is not a sensitive test. Distress or cyanosis are signs of impending respiratory failure and should warrant emergent: nebulised epinephrine, O2 mask, intubation, and dexamethasone. Mild intercostal retractions are typical. Patients that are stable and have no stridor at rest can be discharged home with oral dexamethasone at 0.6mg/kg PO once, with monitoring for improvement within 2-4 hours.

### Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)
Another common cause of pharyngitis. Usually presents with low grade fever (as opposed to bacterial infection). Supportive care.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Throat pain associated with acid reflux, usually worse with supine positioning, smoking, EtOH etc. Treat with PPI and lifestyle changes.

## Urgent Causes
### Inhaled Foreign Body

### Peritonsillar abscess (clinical or CT)
High fever, neck pain, sore throat and dysphagia followed by torticollis, drooling, respiratory distress and stridor

Fever, hot potato voice. Deviated uvula. Trismus.

### Epiglottitis (thumb sign on XR)
Patient prefers neck extension. Keep patient calm and intubate if needed.

Absence of barky cough, sudden onset of high fever, dysphagia, drooling, toxic appearance, anxious appearance and sitting forward in the ‘sniffing’ position

### Parapharyngeal abscess
Trismus

### Retropharyngeal abscess (CT)
Patient prefers neck flexion.

### Ludwig angina
Deep space infection, seen around anterior neck.

### Kawasaki
Strawberry tongue, uveitis, fever.
