# Urinary Tract Infections
Specific symptoms include dysuria and urinary frequency. Usually caused by E coli. Different geographical areas have different resistance patterns.

## Urinalysis and Culture
POC urinalysis is recommended if possible. Perform a culture and sensitivity if needed, especially for recurrent infections. Midstream urine is preferred for diagnosing a UTI.

Positive nitrites is strong positive predictor for bacteria, but negative nitrites is not a strong negative predictor.

Negative leukocytes is a strong negative predictor for bacteria.

Positive blood is a weak predictor overall, but can push your clinical decision towards starting treatment.

## Medications
- nitrofurantoin 100mg BID for 5-7 days
- TMP/SMX (double strength) 160mg/800mg BID for 3 days
