# Urinary Tract Infections
Specific symptoms include dysuria and urinary frequency. Usually caused by E coli. Different geographical areas have different resistance patterns.

Uncomplicated UTIs are defined as non-pregnant female above the age of 15. Complicated UTIs include anything else, including male, immunocompromised, instruments or catheters, structural or functional abnormalities, systemic symptoms such as fever, or flank pain.

## Urinalysis and Culture
POC urinalysis is recommended if possible. Perform a culture and sensitivity if needed, especially for recurrent infections, concern of resistance, or any complicated UTI. Midstream urine culture is preferred for diagnosing a UTI.

Positive nitrites is strong positive predictor for bacteria, but negative nitrites is not a strong negative predictor.

Negative leukocytes is a strong negative predictor for bacteria.

Positive blood is a weak predictor overall, but can push your clinical decision towards starting treatment. Repeat urinalysis when asymptomatic to confirm resolution of hematuria. 

## Uncomplicated UTI Medications
These antibiotics are excreted mainly through urine:
- nitrofurantoin 100mg BID for 5 days
- TMP/SMX (double strength) 160mg/800mg BID for 3 days

## Complicated UTI Medications
Consider possibility of bacteremia. Use culture and sensitivity to guide treatment. Nitrofurantoin should not be used for systemic involvement. For males consider a differential that includes prostatitis, urethritis, and STI. Empiric treatments for males include the same antibiotics as above, but for 7 days. Caution with antibiotic choice in pregnancy.
