# Ethanol
Canadian guidelines are now recommending 2 drinks/week, previously 2 drinks/day. A drink is defined as shot (1.5ounce), beer (355mL), or glass of wine (150mL). Regularly screen for alcohol intake and frequency. Effects include disihibition, memory impairment, and respiratory depression.

## Health Risks
- Liver disease
- Cancer
- Malnutrition
- Pancreatitis
- Atrial fibrillation
- Dementia
- Heart disease
- Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (during pregnancy)

## Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)
Defined in the DSM-5 as either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. In general, AUD is present when alcohol intake affects daily functioning or increasing dependence. Example criteria to help diagnose (meets >= 2):

- Drinking more than intended
- Unable to cut back
- Affecting work or social interactions
- Risky behaviour
- Withdrawal symptoms

Medications to decrease alcohol intake:
- naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that decreases cravings and alcohol quantity
- acamprosate, a GABA modulator that increases alcohol abstinence

## Nutritional deficiency
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, with changes in memory, movement, ataxia, oculomotor dysfunction, possibly delirium. Usually due to chronic alcoholism, but can be caused by malnutrition or hyperemesis. Treatment is thiamine IV 300 mg over 30 minutes TID for 2 days, then 300 mg IV/PO OD for 5 days.

- Provide IV thiamine before giving IV glucose
- Add B-complex multivitamin and folic acid (vitamin B9)

## Acute Alcohol Poisoning
Assess for hypotension and respiratory depression, provide supportive care. Check EtOH levels, glucose, extended electrolytes, VBG, anion gap and ketones.
- Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: possible methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion
- Ketosis without acidosis: possible isopropyl alcohol ingestion.
- Alcoholic Ketoacidosis: in long-term drinkers, treat with IVF and IV dextrose

Altered mental status may warrant a urine drug screen and CT head imaging. Ingestion of alcohol with benzodiazepines is dangerous, Flumazenil can be considered, but it may cause seizures and withdrawal symptoms. Watch for refeeding syndrome.

## Alcoholic liver disease
The complications of overconsumption of alcohol include fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is a severe form of fatty liver accompanied by inflammation. Fatty liver can be reversible, however cirrhosis is a permanent fibrotic process. Monitor liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT) which provide a marker of liver inflammation. AST > ALT with increased MCV indicates alcoholic liver disease. Obtain imaging to help stage liver disease. Decreasing caloric intake, and zinc supplementation may help reduce liver injury. Refer to heaptology for moderate to severe hepatic steatosis.

## Alcoholic hepatitis
Defined as moderately elevated AST or ALT (below 500), AST > ALT, and elevated bilirubin, with other causes ruled out (such as biliary tree, viral, medications, hemochromatosis, Wilson's, autoimmune). Must have recent heavy alcohol ingestion (last 2 months). Symptoms include those of liver failure: fever, jaundice, RUQ pain, ascites, encephalopathy, high PT/INR. Calculation of Maddrey's Discriminant Function > 32 indicates a possible benefit of corticosteroid (prednisolone 40 mg/day for 28 days). Check creatinine to identify hepatorenal syndrome. Increased protein intake (100g/day) improves outcomes.

## Alcohol Withdrawal and Benzodiazepine Withdrawal
A potentially life threatening illness, begins 6-24 hours after last drink. Between 24-48 hours is highest risk for seizures. Treat with benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam) using the CIWA protocol. Gabapentin may also help. Keep NPO for 24-48 hrs to prevent aspiration for more severe cases. Watch for delirium tremens starting 48 hours after last drink, which presents as tachycardia, agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations.
