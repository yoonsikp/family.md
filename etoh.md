# Ethanol
Canadian guidelines are now recommending 2 drinks/week, previously 2 drinks/day. A drink is defined as shot (1.5ounce), beer (355mL), or glass of wine (150mL). Regularly screen for alcohol intake and frequency.

## Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)
Defined in the DSM-5 as either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. In general, AUD is present when alcohol intake affects daily functioning or increasing dependence. Example criteria to help diagnose (meets >= 2):

- Drinking more than intended
- Unable to cut back
- Affecting work or social interactions
- Risky behaviour
- Withdrawal symptoms

## Acute Alcohol Poisoning
Can result in disihibition, memory impairment, respiratory depression, and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Check EtOH levels, glucose, electrolytes, VBG, anion gap and ketones. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis can indicate methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion. Ketosis without acidosis can indicate isopropyl alcohol ingestion. Alcohol ketoacidosis can occur in long-term drinkers, and should be treated with IVF and IV dextrose. Altered mental status may warrant a urine drug screen and CT head imaging. Ingestion of alcohol with benzodiazepines is dangerous, Flumazenil can be considered, but it may cause seizures and withdrawal symptoms.

## bloodwork
affects liver, high risk for cirrhosis

check aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio >1

Elevated bilirubin in alcoholic hepatitis

increases pancreatitis risk

## Withdrawal
CIWA protocol
watch for delirium tremens
life threatening
treat with benzo, lorazepam
gabapentin may help

## Long term
Thiamine deficiency --> Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome 
- memory, movement, coordination
IV thiamine and IVF
multivitamin OR add folic acid

phosphorus
magnesium

refeeding syndrome

## long term
- naltrexone
- acamprosate
