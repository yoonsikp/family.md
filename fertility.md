# Fertility

## Menstrual Cycle
- Menstruation is the discharge of blood from the uterine lining
- The first day of menstruation is the date of the last menstrual period (LMP)
- Fertilization happens 2 weeks after LMP, and pregnancies last for 38 weeks after fertilization (2 + 38 = 40 weeks after LMP)
- Spike in estrogen ~2 weeks after LMP is responsible for ovulation, oocyte leaves the follicle and enters the fallopian tubes
- Corpus luteum develops from the empty follicle, and secretes progesterone, which helps support the oocyte implantation with the uterine lining
- Usually most fertile between 4 days before ovulation to one day after

## Female Hormonal Regulation
- GnRH from hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH
- Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding
- Systemic estrogen-only therapy, chronic anovulation (such as in polycystic ovarian syndrome), obesity, and estrogen-secreting tumors can lead to abnormal endometrial changes
- GnRH antagonists block the pituitary gland from releasing FSH and LH, while GnRH agonists initially increase the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary
- GnRH antagonists or multi-day use of GnRH agonists (through downregulation), both act to stop the pituitary from releasing LH and FSH, also used during Ovarian Hyperstimulation for IVF

## Secondary Amenorrhea
-  Beta-HCG, TSH, prolactin
-  FSH, LH
-  T, DHEAS, 17-hydroxyprogesterone
