## Menstrual Cycle
- Menstruation is the discharge of blood from the uterine lining
- The first day of menstruation is the date of the last menstrual period (LMP)
- Fertilization happens 2 weeks after LMP, and pregnancies last for 38 weeks after fertilization (2 + 38 = 40 weeks after LMP)
- Spike in estrogen ~2 weeks after LMP is responsible for ovulation, oocyte leaves the follicle and enters the fallopian tubes
- Corpus luteum develops from the empty follicle, and secretes progesterone, which helps support the oocyte implantation with the uterine lining
- Progesterone is secreted during pregnancy and suppresses ovulation
- Usually most fertile between 4 days before ovulation to one day after
- Recommend use of cycle tracking apps

## Female Hormonal Regulation
- GnRH from hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH
- Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding
- Systemic estrogen-only therapy, chronic anovulation (such as in polycystic ovarian syndrome), obesity, and estrogen-secreting tumors can lead to abnormal endometrial changes
- GnRH antagonists block the pituitary gland from releasing FSH and LH, while GnRH agonists initially increase the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary
- GnRH antagonists or multi-day use of GnRH agonists (through downregulation), both act to stop the pituitary from releasing LH and FSH, also used during Ovarian Hyperstimulation for IVF

## Secondary Amenorrhea Workup
- Beta-HCG, TSH, prolactin
- FSH, LH (high in premature ovarian insufficiency)
- T, DHEAS, 17-hydroxyprogesterone
- Progestin challenge
- OCP challenge

## Progestin Challenge
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), Provera 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg tablets

## Contraception
Ask, "Do you want to be pregnant?". Conduct urine pregnancy test if needed.

### Emergency Contraception
- Plan B, Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg tablet, one dose, within 72 hrs
  - Progestin inhibits ovulation
- Copper IUD, within 7 days

### Non-pharmacologic
- Rhythm/temperature tracking (good for conception as well)
- Lactational amenorrhea (LAM)
- Barrier methods (condoms, cervical cap)
- Sterilization

### Pharmacologic
- Hormonal/Copper IUD
  - Progestin-containing IUDs are very effective for long-term bleeding control
- Vaginal Ring
- Transdermal Patch
- Oral Contraceptive Pill
- Progestin Injection, Depo-Provera (q 3 months)
- Progestin Implant, Nexplanon (q 3 years)

### Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCP)
No proven benefit to multi or biphasic pills. Progestin-only contraceptives have less contraindications.

### Progestin-only Pill (POP)
- Norethisterone 350ug, Micronor, (28 active tablets taken at same time daily)
  - slight conversion to estrogen, good for premenopausal women
- Drospirenone 4 mg, Slynd, 24/4 dosing regimen (24 active tablets plus four inactive tablets taken once-daily for 28 consecutive days)
  - long 24 hr window, +risk of clot, contraindication in smokers or renal impairment

### Combined OCP (COCP)
Lower-dose estrogen, around 30 mcg to 35 mcg is a good starting point when choosing COCPs. Contraindication in smokers > 35, hypertension, migraine with aura, history of clots.
- Marvelon 21 and 28, 0.15 mg desogestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol 
- Brevicon 21 and 28, 0.5 mg/1mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol 
- Yaz Plus 24/4, 3.0 mg drospirenone, 0.020 mg ethinyl estradiol, 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium (folic acid) tablets (lowest stroke risk)

### Switch between COCP and POP
- To switch from a 28-Day COCP to POP, patients should not take any of the 7 inactive pills from the combined pill pack
- To switch from POP to COCP, take COCP "Day 1" on first day of menstruation
