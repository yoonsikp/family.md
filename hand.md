# Common Disorders of the Hand

## Dupuytren's Disease
History: Joint contractures, chords nodules pits, thumb adduction

Consider dupuytren's diathesis (younger, plantar fibromatosis, nodules on PIP joints)

Special Tests: sensation, tabletop test (>5mm gap between flat hand and table)

Management: smoking cessation, attempt conservative approach first (short term splint or physio), PIP contracture is indication for surgery, will need XRays if considering surgery (Needle aponeurotomy vs fasciotomy), collagenase not available in Canada (high recurrence rates)

## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
History: onset, progression, numbness, functional status i.e. dropping objects or grip strength, handedness + occupation
check for DM2, and other risk factors

Exam: check for thenar wasting, thumb opposition, wrist swelling, sensation + strength, Tinnels + Phalen's test (consider Durkan test)

Management: bracing + physiotherapy if mild (8+ weeks), if moderate to severe symptoms do a NCS and consider surgery, (steroid injection has high recurrence)

## Trigger Finger (stenosing tenosynovitis)
History: snapping resistance when opening finger, sheath becomes inflamed

Exam: check for triggering, focal tenderness or any lesions to palmar region + digit, check ROM of MCP + PIP

Management: can consider ultrasound to check for masses or ganglion cysts, conservative management (splint + NSAID + activity changes), recommend steroid injection first (2-3 attempts), then consider surgery.

## OA Mucous Cyst

DDX: heberden's or bouchards nodes

Management: do an XRay to rule in OA, wait at least 1 year before surgery

## De Quervain's

# Look

# Feel

# Move

Three signs for the motor nerves running to the hand:

- Spread high five ( Ulnar Nerve )
- Thumbs up sign ( Radial Nerve )
- Okay sign ( Median nerve )

Two types of maneuvers to check for tendon injury of each finger digits 1 through 4:

# Special Tests:

### Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP):
hold down middle phalanx and ask the patient to flex at the DIP
### Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS): 
holding 3 of the patientâ€™s other digits in complete extension

Compare with the other hand if you are unsure of normal variation.
