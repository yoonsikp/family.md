# Common Disorders of the Hand

## Dupuytren's Disease
History: Joint contractures, chords nodules pits, thumb adduction

Consider dupuytren's diathesis (younger, plantar fibromatosis, nodules on PIP joints)

Special Tests: sensation, tabletop test (>5mm gap between flat hand and table)

Management: smoking cessation, attempt conservative approach first, PIP contracture is indication for surgery, will need XRays if considering surgery, collagenase not available in Canada (high recurrence rates)

## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
History: onset, progression, numbness, functional status i.e. dropping objects or grip strength, handedness + occupation
check for DM2, and other risk factors

Exam: check for thenar wasting, wrist swelling, sensation + strength, Tinnels + Phalen's test (consider Durkan test)

Management: bracing if mild, if moderate symptoms do a NCS, if severe do surgery
