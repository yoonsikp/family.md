# Sexually Transmitted Infections
Co-infection with multiple STIs is common. 

## Syphilis

Caused by *Treponema pallidum* bacterium (not to be confused with Chancroid). Natural history of disease:
- Primary (initial infection)
- Secondary (2-12 weeks after infection)
- Early Latent (<= 12 months)
- Late Latent (> 12 months)
- Tertiary (years to decades, systemic symptoms)

Sometimes tertiary syphilis is referred to as late syphilis. Approximately one third of untreated syphilis patients will progress to tertiary syphilis, others will remain asymptomatic or have other symptoms.

### Symptoms
With primary infection, symptoms include chancres, i.e. one or more red painless sores on the genital or mouth area, as well as swollen lymph nodes. At any point during infection, syphilis can affect the eyes or ears.

With secondary infection, symptoms include headache, fever, red rough spots on chest or palms/soles, wart-like sores, patchy hair loss, and swollen lymph nodes.

Latent syphilis means asymptomatic infection, with most untreated infections progressing to this stage.

Tertiary syphilis symptoms includes rubbery gummatous growths that can be painful, cardiovascular changes including aneurysm or valvular defects, and neurosyphilis which can cause meningitis-like symptoms or impaired muscle coordination.

### Testing
There are two groups of testing, the treponemal tests which detects exposure to syphilis bacteria, and the non-treponemal tests which detect tissue damage. These tests still require an accurate infection and treatment history.

- Treponemal tests include EIA (enzyme immunoassays) and TPPA (*Treponema pallidum* particle agglutination), which detect previous or current infection. Immunoassays are cheaper and good for screening, while TPPA is good for diagnosis.

- Non-treponemal tests (NTT) like RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) detect auto-antibodies that occur with tissue damage. They are better for screening or measuring treatment progress through titres. Both have false positives for autoimmune diseases.

In Ontario, a "reverse algorithm" is used (EIA --> RPR --> TPPA), and an adult with a positive IA and a positive RPR is enough to start treatment for newly-diagnosed or never-treated syphilis. TPPA remains positive in those with a previous or current infection. Repeat tests in 4 weeks if suspected infection. Positive tests in children should be referred out to specialists.

### Management
- Early syphilis: Single injection of long-acting IM Penicillin G Benzathine 2.4 million units (1.2 million units in each gluteal muscle)
- Late latent or tertiary syphilis: Three injections of long-acting IM Penicillin G Benzathine 2.4 million units (1.2 million units in each gluteal muscle), once per week
- Neurosyphilis: Consult specialist

Followup NTT titres regularly until normal or low-stable, for example at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

## Gonorrhea
Caused by *Neisseria gonorrhea* bacterium. Can infect the genitals, rectum, or throat. Can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. There is increasing antibiotic resistance, although less so with cephalosporins.

### Symptoms
With infection of the genitals, symptoms include dysuria and abnormal discharge. For men, this includes burning at the urethral opening, or painful testicles. Women may have pain with intercourse, lower abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal bleeding. With rectal infection, anal itching, pain, or discharge may occur.

### Testing
Detected in urine sample, endocervical, rectal, or throat swabs with Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). For women, endocervical has higher sensitivity compared to others. For men, first-void or first-catch urine is preferred over urethral. In the MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) population, including a rectal swab and throat swab will help prevent missed infections.

### Management
Ceftriaxone 250-500mg IM once + Azithromycin 1g PO once

Newborns receive 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, to prevent Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

## Chlamydia
Caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis* bacterium. Similar to Gonorrhea, it can infect the genitals, rectum, or throat. Can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. *Lymphogranuloma venereum* (LGV) is a recently identified strain (serovars) that can cause serious illness and scarring, and can cause anal complications.
### Symptoms
Similar to Gonorrhea. 
### Testing
Similar to Gonorrhea.
### Management
Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days (21 days for LGV)

## Trichomoniasis
Caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis* protozoan. Also called "trich". The most common non-viral STI with 1-5% global prevalence, more women infected than men. Correlated with reproductive system cancer, although not proven to be causative.

### Symptoms
In women, infection can cause abnormal or purulent vaginal discharge, UTI-like symptoms, vaginal itching, pain with intercourse. Men are largely asymptomatic but may have urethritis or prostatitis.

### Testing
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have replaced cultures as the standard. In women, vaginal swabs are preferred, although endocervical swabs and urine sample are acceptable. For men, first-catch urine sample is preferred. Occasionally and incidentally visualized on PAP smear.

### Management
Metronidazole 500mg PO BID for 7 days

## Hepatitis B
Caused by the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). Sexual transmission is a common route of infection, but other routes include IV drug use, vertical transmission, and healthcare-associated. Acute infection is defined as symptoms lasting less than 6 months and self-resolving. Hepatitis B infection that lasts for more than 6 months are considered to be a chronic infection. Untreated chronic infections are reservoirs for Hepatitis B transmission and spread, and over decades can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Natural history of acute infection:
- Incubation (6 weeks to 6 months)
- Prodrome (few days)
- Icteric phase (days to weeks, jaundice)
- Convalescence (gradual recovery)

Natural history of chronic infection:
- Immune‐tolerant phase
- Immune‐active phase
- Immune‐control phase
- Reactivation phase (vs clearance)

Over 90% of infants and young children with a hepatitis B infection do not show symptoms. In contrast, approximately 30% to 50% of adolescents and adults develop clinical symptoms during an infection.

Infants have a 90% risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection. However, only 1% to 5% of adults develop chronic infection.

### Symptoms

Symptoms of an acute infection include: low-grade fever, malaise, jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, dark urine, and skin rash. Liver function tests and liver enzymes can become abnormal. There is a rare possibility of acute liver failure. 

Symptoms of a chronic infection depend on the phase, but include that of cirrhosis, liver failure, portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Testing
Positive Hepatitis B Surface **Antigen** (**HBsAg**) is indicative of current infection.

Positive Hepatitis B Core **Antibody** (**HBcAb**) is indicative of previous or current infection.

Positive Hepatitis B Surface **Antibody** (**HBsAb**) is indicative of immunity and protection either from a vaccine or previous infection.

Positive **HBsAb** and negative **HBcAb** means Hepatitis B vaccine exposure only.
Negative **HBsAb** and positive **HBcAb** means a possible Hepatitis B infection, which should warrant further investigation.

Liver enzymes and Hepatitis B DNA levels are used when monitoring chronic Hepatitis B infections.

**HBeAg** is a marker of viral replication that decreases with chronic infection, while **HBeAb** gradually increases with chronic infection. The **IgM** (as opposed to IgG) form of **HBcAb** is correlated with viral flares.


### Management
Check for co-infection of Hepatitis C and HIV. Can be prevented with the Hepatitis B Vaccine. Most acute infections only require supportive treatment. Severe symptoms or signs of acute liver failure require hospitalization. Chronic infection should be treated with interferon or antivirals during the Immune‐active and Reactivation phases. Rarely, chronic infections progress to clearance and remission.

## HPV or Genital warts
Caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV), which comprises a family of over 200 related viruses. HPV is the most common viral STI in humans, and can cause anogenital warts and some forms of cancer. As many as 75% of those sexually active will have an anogenital HPV infection in their lifetime.
### Symptoms
Most infections are asymptomatic. Some develop anogenital warts called condylomata acuminata, i.e. small flat or cauliflower like growths that can appear inside or outside the body. For women, these can appear on the vulva, thigh, anus, rectum, vagina, urethra or cervix. In men, these can appear on the penis, scrotum, thigh, anus, or urethra. These growths can cause skin irritation.

### Testing
Pap tests with HPV testing may be performed. Routine testing for HPV is not done.

### Management
The Gardasil9 vaccine prevents infection of many anogenital wart causing and high-risk HPV types. Warts can be removed with cryotherapy, laser, electrocautery, surgery, or topical creams, although they may recur. For women, regular cervical PAP smears for cancer are recommended. For both men and women, an anal PAP smear exists to screen for cancer of the anus, although the value of this testing is debated.

## Herpes simplex
Caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), with two variants called HSV-1 and HSV-2. The herpes simplex viruses establishes a life-long infection with localized flares. In general, HSV-1 affects the mouth, throat, eyes, or central nervous system, and HSV-2 affects the anogenital region. However, HSV-1 can still infect the genitals.

### Symptoms
Single or multiple painful sores in the mouth or lip (i.e. cold sores) that can blister and scab. These can be preceded by tingling. With genital herpes, blisters or sores similarly appear around the genitals. Other general symptoms include fever or fatigue. Physical symptoms usually resolve after 1-2 weeks. Some HSV infections are asymptomatic but continue to shed and are contagious.

### Testing
Herpes can be diagnosed with Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) or viral cultures.

### Management
Antivirals can be used to treat episodes of HSV infection to reduce symptoms. Early treatment is the most effective. However, there is no vaccine and there is no cure. The following are antiviral treatment options:

#### First episode
- Acyclovir 400mg TID for 7-10 days
- Acyclovir 200mg 5 times a day for 7-10 days
- Famciclovir 250mg TID 7-10 days
- Valacyclovir 1000mg BID for 7-10 days

#### Recurrent episodes
Can be provided as "pill in pocket" prescription.
- Acyclovir 400mg TID for 5 days
- Acyclovir 800mg BID for 5 days
- Famciclovir 1000mg BID for 1 day
- Valacyclovir 500mg BID for 3 days

#### Daily suppression for multiple recurrent episodes
- Acyclovir 400 mg PO BID
- Famciclovir 250 mg PO BID
- Valacyclovir 1000 mg PO OD

## HIV
The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2), cause infections that result in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The most prevalent and virulent form of HIV is HIV-1. Commonly transmitted through sexual contact, blood or bodily fluid contact, or vertical transmission. The virus infects CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, which are essential for immune responses against extracellular pathogens. Natural history of disease:

- Primary acute infection (weeks to months)
- Chronic asymptomatic infection (years)
- Chronic symptomatic infection (3-10 years after infection)

### Symptoms
During primary acute infection, symptoms appear 2 to 6 weeks after exposure, and include fever, muscle pain, joint pain, malaise, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, and headache. 

With chronic asymptomatic infection, symptoms may include swollen lymph nodes or generalized lymphadenopathy.

With late and chronic symptomatic infection, symptoms include fever, weight loss, chills, and lymphadenopathy. Other complications include infections of the lungs, esophageal thrush, cachexia, opportunistic infections, Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma.

### Testing
HIV testing in Canadian laboratories include both HIV p24 antigen and HIV antibody testing, with an accurate result within three to six weeks after exposure.

### Management
Those infected can be treated daily antiretroviral therapy (ART) until viral levels are undetectable. HIV infection can be effectively prevented with daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Those at risk of infection can receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) within 72 hours, which may prevent infection.
