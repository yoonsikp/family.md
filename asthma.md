# Asthma

Asthma is the paroxysmal obstruction of airways due to a stimulus, causing wheeze, cough, dyspnea, and sputum. Most of the obstruction in an acute asthma attack is in the tracheobronchial tree. Diagnosis starts at 1 year of age, but needs convincing clinical report. Part of the atopic triad (asthma, eczema, and allergies).

## Testing
Obtain spirometry. Stop bronchodilators and ICS before test.

- FVC: Forced Vital Capacity is the total exhaled lung volume after total inhale.
- FEV1: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second, after total inhale
- PEFR: Peak expiratory flow rate
- MMEFR: maximum mid expiratory flow rate between 25%-75%

FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 is indicative of obstructive disease. (>0.8 normal, 0.6-0.8 moderate, <0.6 severe). Asthma has variable PEFRs. Flow volume loop will show scooping. CXR may show hyperinflation. Hallmarks of asthma are reversibility: after SABA FEV1 increases 12% or 200mL, and provocation: after methacholine FEV1 decreases 20%, after exercise decreases 10%. FVC takes longer to recover vs. FEV1.

## Acute Exacerbation
- O2 titrate to ~92%
- SABA (e.g. Salbutamol 4-8 puffs q20-30 min x3)
- SAMA (e.g. Ipratropium 4-8 puffs q20-30 min x3)
- PO/IV Steroids (e.g. Prednisone 30-60mg or 2 mg/kg OD for 5 days)
- IV Magnesium Sulfate 40 mg/kg (max 2g) over 30 min.
- IV Salbutamol (reserve for ICU setting)
- IV Epinephrine can be used as well

## Outpatient Treatment (GINA)
Avoidance of triggers and medications. Recommend using a spacer with Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs). 

### Adults
For rescue puffer, start low dose ICS-LABA PRN or SABA. Start a scheduled controller based on symptoms:
- 1x a month: low dose ICS-LABA PRN
- less than half of days: daily low dose ICS or ICS-LABA PRN
- more than half of days: daily low dose ICS-LABA
- more than half of days with low lung function: medium dose ICS-LABA

### Children
For a rescue puffer, use a SABA. Start a scheduled controller based on symptoms:
- 1x a month: nothing
- less than half of days: daily low dose ICS
- more than half of days: daily low dose ICS-LABA
- more than half of days with low lung function: referral to respirologist

## Examples of ICS/LABA:

* Budesonide/Formoterol (Symbicort)
* Fluticasone/Salmeterol Inhalation (Advair)
* Mometasone/Formoterol (Zenhale)
