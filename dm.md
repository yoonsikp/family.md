# Diabetes Mellitus

## Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
- incidence peaks in children from 4-14 yrs of age
- should not use HgB A1C to diagnose, instead use fasting glucose
- start insulin early

## Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)

### Testing
- HgB A1C is a measure of blood glucose over the past 3 months.
- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), measure glucose after no caloric intake for 8 hrs
- 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) after drinking 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
- Random blood glucose

### Diagnosis
- Requires a confirmatory test if not showing signs of hyperglycemia
- FPG >= 7.0 mmol/L
- HgB A1C >= 6.5% (in adults)
- 2hPG in a 75 g OGTT >= 11.1 mmol/L
- Random PG >= 11.1 mmol/L

## Prediabetes
- High risk for developing diabetes
- HgB A1C between 6.0–6.4

## Pharmacologic Management
Target HgB A1C <= 7.0, <=8.5 if frail or recurring hypoglycemia. Should be measured at least every 3 months when glycemic targets are not being met.

- metformin
    - 500mg BID or TID
    - increases efficiency of insulin
    - start if eGFR >30
- gliclazide (sulfonylurea)
    - increases insulin production
- semaglutide (glp1 agonist)
    - Ozempic (weekly injection), 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg once weekly
    - Rybelsus (daily oral), 3 mg once daily for 30 days, then 7 mg once daily
    - start if eGFR >30
    - creates more pancreatic cells
    - weight loss
- empagaflozin (sglt2 inhibitor)
    - Jardiance (daily oral), 10mg daily in the morning
    - start if eGFR >20
    - releases more glucose through urine
    - cardio and nephro protective
- insulin
    - basal only: starting dose 0.2 units per kg (minimum 10 units, up to 15 to 20 units), titrate up 2-4 units every 3 days by checking fasting glucose, target fasting blood glucose (BG) of 4-7 mmol/L
    - basal + prandial: prandial checks before meals, add lispro 4 units before meals, titrate up 2 units every 3 days by checking pre-meal glucose (4-7 mmol), stop sulfonylurea
- glucagon agonist (BAQSIMI)
    - for hypoglycemic states

## Hypoglycemic Risk
Those on basal insulin may benefit from having a small snack of complex carbohydrate + protein before bedtime.

## Inpatient Management
- for critical care patients, continuous IV infusion of insulin to maintain BG >6 and BG <10
- for peri-operative (cardiac), continuous IV infusion of insulin to maintain BG >5 and BG <10
- for general medicine use a basal bolus supplement to target fasting BG 5.0 and 8.0 mmol, random <10
- Diabetes Canada insulin order set 
    - estimate total daily dose, TDD = 0.4 times weight in kg
    - basal = TDD * 0.4
    - bolus = TDD * 0.2 (3 meals, hold if not eating)
    - supplemental = see chart (https://guidelines.diabetes.ca/GuideLines/media/Docs/Key%20Messages/in-hospital-management-clinical-order-set-fillable.pdf)

## Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) VS Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)
DKA mostly T1DM. HHS mostly T2DM. DKA has acidosis, ketones plus anion gap. Trigger includes infection or sepsis. Treatment generally IV fluids, potassium replacement. Insulin starts once K+ >= 3.3. IV regular insulin bolus 0.1 units/kg with IV infusion 0.1 units/kg/hr or subcut short acting insulin 0.3units/kg with 0.1units/kg every hr. Continue giving insulin until BG <14, then supplement with IV dextrose.

## Risk Management
Should be started on a statin above age 40 to reduce cardiovascular risk. ACE inhibitors or ARBs can be used to reduce kidney disease. Empagliflozin also helps with reducing kidney disease and cardiovascular risk.
