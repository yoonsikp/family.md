## Morning Sickness vs Hyperemesis Gravidarum
Morning sickness: usually resolves after the first trimester, small snacks and saltine crackers may help. Diclectin 4-8 tablets a day, or Benadryl PRN.
Hyperemesis gravidarum: severe vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte balances. Possibly linked to GDF15 hormone. May require hospitilization for IVF.

## Pregnancy and Implantation
At-home urine tests have specificity ~99% approximately 2 weeks post ovulation. Confirmatory beta HCG is not needed. Ectopic pregnancy occurs at a rate of approximately 2%, and requires emergency treatment. 80% of miscarriages happen during the 1st trimester, symptoms include spotting and cramping. Molar pregnancies are unviable pregnancies, can be detected during routine ultrasound, can also be detected by abnormally elevated beta HCG levels. Ultrasound and beta HCG trend for suspected abortion, trend beta HCG to zero for suspected ectopic.

  - Di di can still be identical or fraternal, monitor with imaging q4w after 24w
  - mono di, and mono mono are identical, should have urgent OB/GYN

- referral to OB/GYN

### 20 weeks
- review anatomy scan (check for neural tube defects)
- OB/GYN should take over care
- early GDM screen for high-risk individuals

### 26 weeks
- GDM screen
- CBC and any other indicated labs
- discuss fetal surveillance and kick counting

### 30 weeks
- review GDM screen
  - BG targets: <5.5 fasting, <6.7 2-hr post prandial
  - start with dietary + lifestyle changes, may require basal or bolus insulin
- depression screening

### 34 weeks
- Tdap vaccine for mother
- Routine visit

### 36 weeks
- GBS swab
- delivery site planning

### >38 weeks
- close BP monitoring
- go to hospital if water broken, or if contractions 5 minutes apart, lasting for 1 minute, for > 1 hour (5-1-1 rule)

## Postpartum Care
- Postpartum Recovery, may benefit from 5 days of rest then 5 days of light activity 
- Postpartum bleeding (Lochia) is common, fever is a red flag
  - Red blood/clots/cramping for 4 days
  - Brownish pink discharge for 4-12 days
  - Yellowish/whitish painless discharge for 1-4 weeks
- Continue folic acid or multivitamin for 3-6 months
- Postpartum depression (PPD)
  - Ensure baby safety
  - SSRI vs ?Zuranolone treatment
- Postpartum thyroiditis
  - check for thyroid sx, and TSH and T4
- Postpartum pituitary necrosis
  - rare disorder of the pituitary gland/endocrine system
  - may present with agalactorrhea 
- Contraception
  - Lactational amenorrhea (LAM) for natural birth control
  - Progestin-only contraceptives or IUD 1 month after birth
- T2DM screening for those with GDM within 6 months

## Conditions during Pregnancy
- Hypertension
  - Gestational Hypertension
  - Pre-eclampsia (above + proteinuria) or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets)
  - Eclampsia (above + seizures)
- Skin changes
  - Cholestasis of pregnancy (itchy skin, jaundice) vs acute fatty liver of pregnancy (jaundice, thirst)
  - Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (raised itchy rash near trunk, 3rd trimester)
  - Prurigo of pregnancy (itchy extensors/extremities, any trimester)
- Thyroid
  - Beta-HCG acts like TSH
  - Normal TSH during Pregnancy: 0.1-2.5 (1st trimester), 0.2-3.0 (2nd trimester), 0.3-3.0 (3rd trimester)
  - Only screen if past history of thyroid conditions, goiter, radiation therapy, or any history of autoimmune disease
