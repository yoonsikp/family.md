# Thyroid
Hypothyroidism is relatively common affecting 5-10% of the general population, while hyperthyroidism is closer to 1%. Secondary causes of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism are exceedingly rare.

## Goiter
Non-specific swelling of the thyroid, usually non-painful. Toxic goiter is defined as goiter with hyperthyroid symptoms, with nontoxic goiter defined as goiter with a euthyroid state. Commonly associated with iodine deficiency in less developed countries, which can be detected with high TSH, low T4, and low urine iodine concentrations. Other common causes include Hashimoto's thyroiditis (hyperthyroid which progresses to hypothyroid), and Grave's disease (hyperthyroid). Goiter can be linked to either hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, thus requiring further investigation. Goiter can also be associated with benign or malignant tumours of the thyroid.

## Thyroiditis
Describes inflammation of the thyroid, divided into painful and painless thyroiditis. Painful thyroiditis presents with neck pain, throat discomfort, and tenderness to palpation. It can be caused by De Quervain Thyroiditis, radiation or trauma, and rarely acute infectious thyroiditis (bacteria). Painless thyroiditis can be caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, or drug-induced. Painless thyroiditis genereally presents as hyperthyroidism, progressing to euthyroid state, then hypothyroidism.

## Thyroid Nodules
Should be investigated with ultrasound for characterization and diagnosis.

## Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) test
- differentiate hyperthyroidism
- check for hot nodules
- check for suspected thyroid cancer
- Suspected metastasis of thyroid cancer

## Symptoms of Hypothyroidism
- Dry skin
- Weight gain
- Decrease in appetite
- Cold intolerance
- Depression

## Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism
- Thyroid bruit
- Goiter
- Fast heart rate
- Atrial fibrillation/palpitations
- Nervousness
- Sweating
- Heat intolerance
- Lid lag/proptosis
- Weight loss
- Tremor

## Causes for Hypothyroidism (at later stages)
- Iodine deficiency, treat with iodine-rich salt
- Hashimoto's disease, anti-TPO destroys the thyroid gland
  - high TSH, low T4, positive Anti-TPO antibodies
  - if TSH >10, then treat with synthroid
  - if TSH >7, with normal T4, can also treat as subclinical
- Postpartum Thyroiditis or Silent Thyroiditis
  - autoimmune component, similar to hashimoto
  - confirmed with decreased RAIU
  - usually resolves by itself
- Euthyroid sick syndrome
  - normal TSH, low T4
  - treat underlying sickness
- Medications e.g. antithyroid, cholestyramine, amiodarone, phenytoin, lithium
- De Quervain Thyroiditis
  - Painful inflammation caused by viral illness or URTI
  - early stage: low TSH, elevated T4, high CRP, fever
  - late stage: high TSH, low T4
  - decreased RAIU
  - Treat with NSAIDs, +/- prednisone, with endocrine consult
- Iatrogenic
- Congenital

### Medications for Hypothyroidism
- Levothyroxine (Synthroid) PO OD, titrate up as needed
  - Taken in the morning on an empty stomach with water
  - For subclinical hypothyroidism start at 1.6mcg/kg, or 25mcg daily

### Causes for Hyperthyroidism (at later stages)
- Grave's disease, autoantibodies to TSH receptor
  - linked to autoimmune conditions, such as RA
  - low TSH, elevated T4, presence of TSHR-antibody, positive anti-TPO
  - diffusely increased RAIU
  - treat with antithyroid medications, radioiodine therapy or surgery
  - medications can manage symptoms
- Toxic goiter
  - single toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter
  - usually benign, but have mutations at the TSH receptor
  - low TSH, elevated T4
  - RAIU shows increased uptake at hot nodules
  - treat with antithyroid medications, radioiodine therapy or surgery
  - medications can manage symptoms
- Thyroid malignancy
- TSH releasing tumor

## Medications for Hyperthyroidism
- Antithyroid medications: methimazole from 5 mg to 60 mg daily
- Beta-blocker for cardiac symptoms or tremor (e.g. atenolol)
