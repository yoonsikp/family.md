# Thyroid
Hypothyroidism affects 5-10% of the general population, hyperthyroidism is closer to 1%. Secondary causes of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism are exceedingly rare.

## Goiter
Swelling of the thyroid. Goiter + hyperthyroid symptoms = toxic goiter, goiter + euthyroid = nontoxic goiter. Common causes include iodine deficiency, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and Grave's disease. Goiter is associated with many diseases, thus requiring further investigation.

## Thyroiditis
Inflammation of the thyroid. Painful thyroiditis presents with neck pain, throat discomfort, and tenderness to palpation. It can be caused by De Quervain Thyroiditis, radiation, trauma, and rarely acute infectious thyroiditis (bacteria). Painless thyroiditis can be caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, or drug-induced. Painless thyroiditis follows a course of hyperthyroidism, then euthyroid state, and then hypothyroidism.

## Thyroid Nodules
Should be investigated with ultrasound for characterization and diagnosis.

## Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) test
- differentiate hyperthyroidism
- check for hot nodules
- check for suspected thyroid cancer, or metastasis of thyroid cancer

## Symptoms of Hypothyroidism
- Dry skin
- Weight gain
- Decrease in appetite
- Cold intolerance
- Depression

## Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism
- Thyroid bruit
- Goiter
- Fast heart rate
- Atrial fibrillation/palpitations
- Nervousness
- Sweating
- Heat intolerance
- Lid lag/proptosis
- Weight loss
- Tremor

## Causes for Hypothyroidism (at later stages)
- Iodine deficiency, treat with iodine-rich salt
  - confirmed with low urine iodine concentrations
- Hashimoto's disease, anti-TPO destroys the thyroid gland
  - in some early stages causes hashitoxicosis, low TSH, high T4
  - late stage: high TSH, low T4, positive Anti-TPO antibodies
  - if TSH >10, then treat with synthroid
  - if TSH >7, with normal T4, can also treat as subclinical
- Postpartum Thyroiditis or Silent Thyroiditis
  - autoimmune component, similar to hashimoto
  - confirmed with decreased RAIU
  - usually resolves by itself
- Euthyroid sick syndrome
  - normal TSH, low T4
  - treat underlying sickness
- Medications e.g. antithyroid, cholestyramine, amiodarone, phenytoin, lithium
- De Quervain Thyroiditis
  - Painful inflammation caused by viral illness or URTI
  - early stage: low TSH, elevated T4, high CRP, fever
  - late stage: high TSH, low T4
  - decreased RAIU
  - Treat with NSAIDs, +/- prednisone, endocrine referral
- Iatrogenic
- Congenital

### Medications for Hypothyroidism
- Levothyroxine (Synthroid) daily, titrate up as needed
  - Taken in the morning on an empty stomach with water
  - For subclinical hypothyroidism start at 1.6mcg/kg, or 25mcg daily

### Causes for Hyperthyroidism (at later stages)
- Grave's disease, autoantibodies to TSH receptor
  - linked to autoimmune conditions, such as RA
  - low TSH, elevated T4, presence of TSHR-antibody, positive anti-TPO
  - diffusely increased RAIU
  - treat with antithyroid medications, radioiodine therapy or surgery
  - medications can manage symptoms
- Toxic goiter
  - single toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter
  - usually benign, but have mutations at the TSH receptor
  - low TSH, elevated T4
  - RAIU shows increased uptake at hot nodules
  - treat with antithyroid medications, radioiodine therapy or surgery
  - medications can manage symptoms
- Thyroid malignancy
- TSH releasing tumor

## Medications for Hyperthyroidism
- Antithyroid medications: methimazole from 5 mg to 60 mg daily
- Beta-blocker for cardiac symptoms or tremor (e.g. atenolol)
