# Common Neuropathies
## Upper Extremity
- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (median nerve)
  - numbness along digits 1-3 + hypothenar wasting
- Ulnar nerve
  - parasthesia along 5th digit and thumb adduction weakness 
- Radial nerve
  - paresthesia back of thumb + wrist drop
  - conservative treatment

## lower extremity
- peroneal neuropathy at the fibular neck (crossed leg numbness)
  - numbness along lateral thigh + unable to dorsiflex / foot drop
  - can do EMG + decompression
- meralgia paresthetica -> pure sensory nerve
  - pain in upper outer thigh with pressure/stress
- ddx: L2-l3 radiculopathy or lumbosacral plexopathy
- femoral neuroapthy (sometimes iatrogenic)
  - sensory loss in medial thigh / saphenous + difficulty lifting up thigh 
  - physiotherapy
 
## polyneuropathy
- common causes
  - dm2, hiv, illness, EESSRD< hypothyroid, B12, amyloid, etoh, thyroid, medications, autoimmune, multiple myeloma
- starts with sensory (i.e. pinprick and proprioception) then muscle weakness
- differential - radiculopathy, mononeuropathy, spinal cord / CNS disorders (myelopathy)
- NMJ disorder, myopathy, or motor neuron disease
- red flags: asymmetry, non length dependence, motor prominence, acute onset, severe symptoms, sensory ataxia, autonomic features
- Guillain–Barré syndrome (after an infection?)
