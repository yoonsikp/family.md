# Eye 
Rule out infections - viral and bacterial conjunctivitis is common, however other infections such as ocular herpes, shingles, corneal ulcers should be ruled out. Both bacterial endophthalmitis and uveitis (includes ciliary body, iris, and uvea) are medical emergencies. Always do visual acuity on both eyes for any vision loss, and differentiate between painful vs nonpainful.

## Physical Exam
- Visual inspection
- Visual acuity, snellen chart (20 feet (current)/x feet (someone with normal vision))
- Visual fields and finger counting
- Motion
- Light vs dark
- CN 346
- Pupillary response
- Intraocular pressure (IOP) with tonometry (<25 mm Hg is normal)
- Slit lamp w/ fluorescein

## Acute Ocular Emergencies
## Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma
Due to obstruction of drainage of the aqueous humor. Symptoms include eye pain and progressive vision loss, nausea, headache. On exam, signs include a fixed dilated pupil, eye edema (patient may see haloes or haziness). IOP will be raised above >50 mm Hg. Treatment includes Diamox (500 mg PO or IV), Timolol (0.5% eyedrop, one drop on affected eye), Mannitol (20% IV, 1-2g/kg over 60 minutes), or pilocarpine (eyedrops). Attempt target IOP < 40 mm Hg, measured frequently.

## Corneal ulcer
swelling, discharge, blurred vision
pain even with topical lidocaine
serious infection of the cornea
urgent optho consult

## globe rupture
tetanus
antibiotics
patch
optho referral

## glaucoma
## ?shingles/herpes
check dendrites on exam, linear branching patterns
treat: oral + eyedrop antivirals

## orbital cellulitis
- severe pain and proptosis/CN 346 involvment

## retinal detachment?

## Stye / Chalazion
Blockage of sebaceous gland, usually caused by staph

## bacterial conjunctivitis
erythryomicin or Vigamox Ophthalmic

## conjunctivitis vs keratitis
keratitis only affects the cornea and causes pain, not a truge emergency
keratitis photophbia + small pupil
iritis --> referred pain from opposite eye
dont give eye steroids without optho

## corneal abrasion
use polysporin eye drops or vigamox
topical NSAID
refer for large lesions
