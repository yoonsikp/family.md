# Eye 
Do visual acuity on both eyes for any vision loss, and differentiate between painful vs non-painful. Rule out infections - viral and bacterial conjunctivitis is common, however other infections such as ocular herpes, shingles, corneal ulcers should be ruled out. Bacterial endophthalmitis and uveitis (includes ciliary body, iris, and uvea) are both medical emergencies. 

## Physical Exam
- Visual inspection
- Visual acuity, snellen chart (20 feet (current)/x feet (someone with normal vision))
- Visual fields and finger counting
- Motion
- Light vs dark
- CN 346
- Pupillary response
- Intraocular pressure (IOP) with tonometry (<25 mm Hg is normal)
- Slit lamp w/ fluorescein

## Ocular Emergencies
### Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma
Due to obstruction of drainage of the aqueous humor. Symptoms include eye pain and progressive vision loss, nausea, headache. On exam, signs include a fixed dilated pupil, eye edema (patient may see haloes or haziness). IOP will be raised above >50 mm Hg. Treatment includes Diamox (500 mg PO or IV), Timolol (0.5% eyedrop, one drop on affected eye), Mannitol (20% IV, 1-2g/kg over 60 minutes), or pilocarpine (eyedrops, use once stabilized). Attempt target IOP < 40 mm Hg, measured frequently.

### Corneal Ulcer
A serious infection of the cornea that may be caused by ocular trauma. Causes eye irritation, local swelling and discharge, blurred vision. Can be painful even with application of topical lidocaine. On exam, a dull grayish sport may be seen, and if severe a hypopyon (pus collection). Requires urgent optho referral. 

### Globe Rupture
Traumatic rupture of the eye. Use normal saline to wash away any foreign bodies if appropriate. Requires eye patch, do not attempt to remove protruding objects. Requires a tetanus shot, antibiotic eydrops can be given prophylactically. CT scan can be considered to localize the foreign body and any surrounding tissue damage. Consider anti-emetics to help prevent increases in IOP. Urgent optho referral.

### Shingles/Herpes Infection
Usually dermatomal or affecting only half the face. Confirmed with dendrites on fluorescein exam, i.e. linear branching patterns. Treat with oral + eyedrop antivirals.

### Orbital Cellulitis
Infection of the orbits, more common in children. Can spread and is life threatening (as opposed to periorbital cellulitis). Symptoms include severe pain and proptosis/CN 346 involvement. Can be diagnosed with CT scan. If suspecting orbital cellulitis, draw blood cultures and start IV antibiotics. 

### Retinal Detachment
Sudden vision loss, flashes, curtain, and floaters. Urgent optho referral for surgery. 

### Primary Meningococcal Conjunctivitis
Presents with acute and marked purulent conjunctivitis. Conjunctival swabs should be collected. For suspected meningococcal disease, systemic treatment should be immediately started, e.g. IV Ceftriaxone 2g OD for 7-12 days, to prevent complications and fatality.

## Other Ocular Conditions
### Open Angle Glaucoma
Typically painless, chronic, and not a medical emergency

### Stye / Chalazion
Blockage of sebaceous gland, usually caused by staph aureus. Treat with warm compresses and erythromycin ointment (BID). Can take several weeks for resolution. 

### Bacterial Conjunctivitis
Seen commonly in one eye with crusting/discharge. Usually minimal vision changes. Treat with erythryomicin ointment at night time and Vigamox Ophthalmic drops during the day. For gonococcal conjunctivitis treat with Ceftriaxone 2g IV/IM once + Azithromycin 1g PO once.

### Other Conjunctivitis and Keratitis
Other causes of conjunctivitis include allergic, viral, etc. Keratitis is inflammation only affecting the cornea, usually not a true emergency. Microbial keratitis is common in contact lens users and should be treated with Vigamox eyedrops for Pseudomonas coverage. Some autoimmune conditions also present with conjunctivitis / uveitis symptoms. Do not prescribe steroids without optho referral.

### Corneal Abrasion
Blurry vision and discomfort post corneal injury. Can be confirmed with fluorescein exam. Treat with OTC Polysporin eye drops or Vigamox. Topical ketorolac can be used for short term (QID 1-2 days) for discomfort. Refer to ophtho for large lesions.
