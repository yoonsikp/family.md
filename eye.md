# Eye 
Rule out infections - viral and bacterial conjunctivitis is common, however other serious infections such as ocular herpes, shingles, corneal ulcers. Both bacterial endophthalmitis and uveitis (includes ciliary body, iris, and uvea) are medical emergencies. Always do visual acuity on both eyes for any vision loss, and differentiate between painful vs nonpainful.

## Physical Exam
- Visual inspection
- Visual acuity, snellen chart (20 feet (current)/x feet (normal vision))
- Visual fields
- Finger counting
- Motion
- Light vs dark
- CN 346
- Pupillary response
- Ocular pressure
- Slit lamp w/ fluorescein

## Acute presentations
## acute angle closure
painful and vision loss
?headache
eye may be hazy
check IOP (<25 is normal)

treat: with timolol, pilocarpine, mannitol

## Corneal ulcer
swelling, discharge, blurred vision
pain even with topical lidocaine
serious infection of the cornea
urgent optho consult
## globe rupture
tetanus
antibiotics
patch
optho referral

## glaucoma
## ?shingles/herpes
check dendrites on exam, linear branching patterns
treat: oral + eyedrop antivirals

## orbital cellulitis
- severe pain and proptosis/CN 346 involvment

## retinal detachment?

## Stye / Chalazion
Blockage of sebaceous gland, usually caused by staph

## bacterial conjunctivitis
erythryomicin or Vigamox Ophthalmic

## conjunctivitis vs keratitis
keratitis only affects the cornea and causes pain, not a truge emergency
keratitis photophbia + small pupil
iritis --> referred pain from opposite eye
dont give eye steroids without optho

## corneal abrasion
use polysporin eye drops or vigamox
topical NSAID
refer for large lesions
