# Headache

## Undifferentiated Headache
Red flags that may indicate more timely investigations: new headache especially over age 50, worst headache of their life (?SAH), focal neurological deficits (?stroke), head trauma (?bleed), post LP (CSF leak --> bed rest and fluids), and rapidly progressing frequency of headaches (?structural). Fever/infection may indicate a CNS infection. Exertional headaches may sometimes be caused by intracranial abnormalities and may warrant MRI, although commonly caused be cough. Temporal pain with jaw claudication or vision changes can be GCA. Seizures with headache should warrant urgent imaging (?lesion).

## Examination
Headache physical examination should include a BP, GCS/MSE screen, neurological screening, CN screening, and neck exam. A hazy edematous cornea may indicate acute angle closure glaucoma.

## Migraine Headache
Most common is migraine. Symptoms include: pulsating feeling, one-day duration, unilateral (in 70%), nausea or vomiting, and disabling (POUND mnemonic).  The duration generally lasts from 4 to 72 hours. Has a gradual onset with symptoms that chronic sufferers will recognize (irritability, inability to concentrate). 

### Aura
Migraines can be accompanied by aura in a subset of the population. This is characterized by the onset of visual, sensory, or speech symptoms during or shortly before the migraine. This can include bright or falshing lights, or creeping numbness. These symptoms should fully resolve with resolution of the migraine.

### Causes
Common causes include stress, lack of sleep, lights, weather, and certain foods (high histamine or tyramine foods may be a culprit, cheeses, preserved meats, alcohol, Aspartame, tomatoes). Other specific causes include hormonal (menstruation or menopause) and medication induced. A headache diary can be useful.

### Treatment
Mild cases can be treated with rest, dark room, and NSAIDs or Tylenol + baby aspirin. Other considerations include caffeine, hydration. Those with chronic migraines can be prescribed CGRP receptor antagonists or triptans as an abortive medication: e.g. Ubrelvy or Rizatriptan dissolving tablet 5-10mg PO q2h, max 20mg/day. More severe cases may need hospitilization for IV fluids, triptans, IM NSAIDs, IV magnesium, antiemetics (metoclopramide). If persistent, consider opioids and IV valproic acid.

## Prevention
Some preventative methods include propranolol BID, TCAs, Magnesium 300-500 mg per day, creatine, hydration. CoQ10 supplements. Schedule triptans or COCP for those with hormonal migraines.

## Tension Headache
Can be diagnosed as non-pulsating pain bilaterally, akin to a tight ring around the head. It can radiate to the back of the head and neeck. There should be no nausea or vomiting. The duration can last from 30 minutes to 7 days. Sometimes has overlap with muscle strain associated headaches.

### Treatment
Similar to above, NSAIDs, ASA, Tylenol can be used. Hydration. Avoid stress and anxiety. Prevention through TCAs (e.g. amitriptyline qHS, start at 10mg then increase by 10mg).

## Cluster Headache
Characterized by severe excruciating pain unilaterally around the eye or temples with additional involvment of the tear ducts, conjunctiva, miosis, or facial swelling. These episodes or attacks can last 15 minutes to 3 hours with multiple in a day. 

### Treatment
Start on 100% O2, subcutaenous sumatriptan 6mg. Prophylaxis is verapamil 240mg/day.

## Medication Overuse Headaches
Frequent usage of NSAIDs/painkillers (>15 days/month) or triptans (>10 days/month) can sometimes lead to withdrawal symptoms and rebound headaches. 

### Treatment
Counsel and provide alternative medication for limited usage. Treat any comorbidities. Start prophylaxis treatment.

## Cervicogenic Headache
Unilateral head pain caused by radiation from the neck, usually caused by soft tissues. For example, arthritis, a slipped disk, etc.
